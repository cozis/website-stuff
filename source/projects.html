							Ray tracing is a popular algorithm for redering 3D scenes where propagation of light rays is simulated to determine this final color of each pixel. I wrote this to learn about global illumination.

						<p>
							It's a 3D renderer I built to dive deeper into graphics programming, using as reference the great <a href="https://learnopengl.com/">LearnOpenGL</a> tutorial and <a href="https://google.github.io/filament/Filament.html">Google's Filament</a>. The renderer implements Physically Based Rendering (PBR), a technique that simulates light and shadows to closely mimic real-world behavior. It supports shadow mapping, Image-Based Lighting (IBL), and can load meshes from external files.

			<p>
				MicroTCP is a user-space network stack I developed in university to better understand TCP and lower-level protocols like IP, ICMP, and ARP. It provides two interfaces: a blocking, BSD socket-like interface and a non-blocking, epoll-like interface for handling multiple connections efficiently. I tested it by porting xHTTP to it, an HTTP/1.1 implementation I wrote previously. You can also check out a discussion about it on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38086598">Hacker News</a>.
			</p>

			<h3><a href="https://github.com/cozis/blogtech" target="_blank">Blogtech</a></h3>
			<p>
				This is the web server used to host this blog. I wrote it to see how hard it would be to write services facing the public internet from scratch.
				<br />
				<br />
				After writing the first prototype I hosted it on a small VPS and asked <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/1falo3b/using_my_c_web_server_to_host_a_blog_you_cant/">Reddit (r/C_Programming)</a> to break it, which helped make the program more robust. One day I woke up and the server wasn't responding anymore. Turns out someone stress tested it so much during the night the log file fille the VPS hard drive. It took 3 hourds to download the 40GB log file to my machine!
				<br />
				<br />
				After implementing log file rotation I went back to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hacking/comments/1fcc5hd/im_using_my_custom_c_webserver_to_host_my_blog_no/">Reddit (r/hacking this time)</a> asking people to break it again! This went better than last time.
				<br />
				<br />
				I took some time adding HTTPS support using BearSSL (and fix some nasty bug that popped up) and posted it on <a target="_blank" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41642151">Hacker News</a> where it got quite a bit of interest. The project managed to reach the front page, which is super cool because I got to test the server with higher traffic! The server managed to serve around 70K requests the first day with no issues.

			<h3><a href="https://github.com/cozis/noja" target="_blank">Noja</a></h3>
			<p>
				This is the first "serious" project I worked on. It's an interpreter for a high level language I designed from scratch. It taught me how to manage non-trivial codebases and how important it is to keep complexity low.

				The language supports features like multiple return values, default argument values, and closures. It was a great learning experience and helped me understand interpreters deeply. You can find various examples in the examples/ folder of the GitHub repository, including an HTTP server I ported to the language.
